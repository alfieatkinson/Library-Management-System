## Project Overview

This project is a console-based library management system written in C++. It supports adding, removing, and searching for books within a library. The system is designed to be extensible, allowing for the addition of more features such as user management, networking capabilities, and persistence with a database.

### Report Abstract

*This paper presents the design and implementation of a console-based library management system developed in C++. The system encompasses core functionalities such as book and user management, facilitating the addition, removal, and searching of library resources. It incorporates advanced features including borrowing and returning operations, data persistence through a database, multi-threading for efficient concurrency, and networking support for remote access. Additionally, there is potential for future enhancements such as advanced search capabilities, enhanced user management, and improved data visualisation. Through a modular and well-structured architecture, the Library Management System ensures seamless interaction between its components, providing a robust solution for managing library resources effectively.*

## Features

- **Book Management**:  
  - Add, remove, and search for books in the catalogue.  
  - Each book is represented as a `Book` class, managing attributes such as title, author, ISBN, year published, and availability status.
  - Methods include `getID()`, `getTitle()`, `getAuthor()`, `getISBN()`, `getYearPublished()`, `isAvailable()`, `setTitle()`, `setAuthor()`, `setISBN()`, `setYearPublished()`, `setIsAvailable()`, `borrowBook()`, `returnBook()`, and `getInfo()`.

- **User Management**:  
  - Add, remove, and manage library users.  
  - Each user is represented as a `User` class, managing attributes such as username, forename, surname, email, phone number, password, and borrowed books.
  - Methods include `getID()`, `getUsername()`, `getForename()`, `getSurname()`, `getEmail()`, `getPhoneNumber()`, `getPassword()`, `getBorrowedBooks()`, `setUsername()`, `setForename()`, `setSurname()`, `setEmail()`, `setPhoneNumber()`, `setPassword()`, `borrowBook()`, `returnBook()`, `checkOutStatus()`, and `getInfo()`.

- **Borrow and Return Books**:  
  - Track which user has borrowed which book and manage the due dates for returns.  
  - Implement transactions via a `Transaction` class that captures book borrowing and returning details along with timestamps.
  - Methods include `getID()`, `getType()`, `getStatus()`, `getBook()`, `getUser()`, `getDatetime()`, `setStatus()`, `setDatetime()`, `execute()`, `cancel()`, and `getInfo()`.

- **Networking for Concurrent Remote Access**:  
  - Enable remote access to the library system through a server-client architecture.  
  - Implement server-side functionality using the `Server` class and client-side operations using sockets.
  - The `Server` class handles client connections, manages threads for concurrent client handling, and communicates with the `Application` class.

- **Data Persistence with JSON**:
  - Enable data persistence through the `PersistenceManager` class which saves and loads data to and from the `Database`.
  - If there is no data to load, `Database` is populated with sample data for testing.

- **Additional Functionalities**:  
  - **Pagination**: Implement a method to navigate through long lists of books, users, and transactions efficiently using the `Menu` class.
  - **Approximate Search**: Enable search functionality with fuzzy matching using the `Database` class.

- **Documentation Generation**:  
  - Use Doxygen to generate comprehensive project documentation, detailing classes, methods, and relationships.
